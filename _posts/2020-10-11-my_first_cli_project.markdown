Wow. Going through and trying to code my first CLI project from scratch has been a rollercoaster of a ride.
It's defintely challenged me to take bits and pieces of past experiences to help me get through it.

If I had to tell myself something when I first started Flatiron is that you be patience with yourself. It's ok to fail your code and not understand what's going on exactly. It's part of the learning experience. The flow of coding is to fix broken code as you go along. It defintely challenges your patience to not get things to work right away. But going through it makes you a better problem solver and builds that callus. I use to think it was a lot like learning how to play a new instrument where the time you put into it is what you get out of it. It gets easier as. you do more of it. There's more than one way to do things.

I decide to do have my project based on scrapping the top 5 highest anaylst rated stocks in Robinhood.com. You can grab more info on the stock of your choice. You can grab the stock symbol, current stock price, change in price, market cap, and the anaylst rating overall itself.

It seemed simple enough and is in retrospec. But building the code from the ground up begged the question of what to do first and next? It defintely forces you to think of taking one step at a time. Making mistakes and learning from them.
The beautiful thing about coding is through all the struggle you always gain a little bit of something from the work you put into it. The most exciting thing is the level of growth one can obtain through trial and error and just putting in the work. You definitely need to frame your mind to think of it as a marathon and pace yourself to be patience. There's always going to be progress even if you don't feel it or see it.
