Hi, I’m William Cao. I was born and raised in San Francisco and I’ve worked in hospitality for just over 15 years now. Because of COVID-19 I’ve been unemployed since mid March. I’ve decided to use this time to study software engineering to challenge myself to learn and try something new. 

I was originally going to go back to school to do game design once upon a time, but fell into bartending 6 years ago. I fell in love with bartending and become obsessed. It was fast paced, it kept me on my toes and there was always room for improvement and learn more. It gave me a chance to be creative and see the pay off faster than If was building a video game. My passion and dedication helped me advance up the ranks and eventually had opportunities to run my own bar programs. I started my own cocktail company with my business partner and friend earlier this year. Our ambition is to open a world class cocktail bar in San Francisco. All this changed once I had a daughter and COVID-19 hit. I had to reevaluate my career path and decided to give software engineering a chance.

My old co-worker gave me a phone call and told me about flatiron and here I am trying to learn daily which is challenging but also rewarding so far. I think it’s a smart choice to have another option to provide for my family along with the chance to work from home and not live the stressful life of a bar owner. The world is changing, I had to learn to adapt to those changes as well.
